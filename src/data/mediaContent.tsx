        Stats4Lulu began initially as a one-off weekend project converting a
        handwritten catalog into key statistics able to be understood by the
        public. The project has since grown from a single spreadsheet managed by
        three people to a multi-disciplinary team of over 30 volunteers, with
        broad skills including data, writing, translation and more. Stats4Lulu
        is a comprehensive open-source platform that visualises data on Luigi's
        letters,&nbsp;

        The founder of Stats4Lulu started the project after seeing Luigi's

            Stats4Lulu is a volunteer-run transparency initiative dedicated to
            documenting and visualising verified data about Luigi Mangione's
            correspondence, donations, and media coverage. What began as an
            effort to track thousands of handwritten letter receipts has evolved
            into an open-source resource advocating for transparency, fairness,
            and the constitutional right to a fair trial.

      The project began as a simple effort to digitise Luigi's handwritten
      letter logs, which recorded thousands of messages sent to him from around

      Today, the team includes more than 30 volunteers working across data,
      writing, translation, events and collaborations. Our members see
      themselves as custodians of the statistics related to Luigi. We nurture
      and grow this work, but in the end, it all belongs to Luigi and is shared

            Stats4Lulu recently collaborated with <b>Luigistics</b> to create
            the Luigi Mangione Event Timeline, an interactive visual journey
            through key milestones in Luigi's case. Stats4Lulu provided the
            underlying data and curated event collection, while Luigistics
            digitised the project into an interactive public website. See:&nbsp;

          <p>
            The timeline features videos, photos, legal documents, and
            plain-language summaries for every major event, with user-friendly
            filters by date and event type, plus dark and light modes for
            accessibility. Explore:&nbsp;
